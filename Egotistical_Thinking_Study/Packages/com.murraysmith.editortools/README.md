<h1>Murray's Editor Tools</h1>

This Unity package contains a few editor tools I've built to speed up my work flow. Currently the tools are:

1) A C# batch script to remove all attached components of a certain type from the root GameObject of each prefab in a specified folder. To open this tool, on the menu bar select (MurraysTools -> BatchComponentRemoval)
2) A C# batch script to copy an instance of a component and it's property values to the root GameObject of each prefab in a specified folder. To open this tool, on the menu bar select (MurraysTools -> BatchComponentAdd)

<h2>Installation</h2>

To install, open the Unity Package Manager (Window -> Package Manager), then add a package by clicking the big plus button in the top left corner. Select "Add package from git URL...", and paste in the URL from this github page. Click install then enjoy the tools!
